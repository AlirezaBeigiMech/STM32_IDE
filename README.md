## About The Project

WinFormsApp IDE is a powerful Integrated Development Environment designed specifically for STM32 microcontroller development. Built using C# and incorporating ScintillaNET for advanced text editing features, this IDE offers an intuitive and efficient platform for coding, debugging, and managing STM32 projects. Key features include serial port management, automatic device detection, syntax highlighting, and easy project navigation.

Here's why:
* **Optimized for STM32:** Unlike generic IDEs, WinFormsApp IDE is tailored specifically for STM32 development, offering features and functionalities that align with the needs of STM32 programmers.
* **Advanced Serial Port Management:** Thanks to System.IO.Ports, our IDE offers sophisticated tools for managing serial communications, crucial for microcontroller programming and data transfer.
* **Real-Time Device Management:** Utilizing System.Management, the IDE provides real-time monitoring and management of connected STM32 devices, enhancing the development workflow.
* **Customized User Experience:** Built with user experience in mind, the IDE boasts a customizable interface, syntax highlighting, and other features that make coding more intuitive and less prone to errors.
* **Streamlined Workflow:** With integrated tools for editing, compiling, and debugging, developers can manage their entire STM32 project lifecycle within a single environment.
* **Community and Open Source Spirit:** Being open-source, itâ€™s continuously evolving with contributions from a community passionate about STM32 development.

### Built With

 In this project, I have used some C# libraries. These libraries can be added by using Nuget Package installer.

* **C#** - Programming language
* **.NET 6.0** - Framework
* **[CliWrap](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/CliWrap)**- Library for running command-line processes
* **[ScintillaNET](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET)** - Text editor component
* **[System.Management](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Management/)**  - Namespace for handling events
* **[System.IO.Ports](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.IO.Ports/)** - Namespace for managing serial ports

Moreover, it is necessary to use some softwares for building and loading C embedded code. 

* **[OpenOCD](https://openocd.org/)** - On-chip programmer
* **[ST-Link CLI](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html)** - Software interface for programming STM32 microcontrollers.
